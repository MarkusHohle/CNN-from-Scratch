 Lecture material (codes, pdf). Learning how to create CNNs with numpy only

 Creating a CNN from scratch, only using numpy, step by step. Each chapter contains a fully functional code for the corresponding topic. PDFs of the lecture (from ppt) explaining the mathematical background are added too. Chapters are:

 1 single neuron
 2 layers of neurons
 3 activation
 4 loss and entropy
 5 backprob
 6 optimizer
 7 weights
 8 convolution and images 
 9 max pool
 10 sigmoid
 11 backprob II
 12 LeNet

 Lecture was inspired by the excellent book from Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela
